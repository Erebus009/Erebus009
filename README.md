- Hi, I’m @Travis Puryear
- I’m interested in robotics and functional usage of coding to provide helpful purpose for people and communities. 
- I’m currently learning the basics of Javascript. Before I begin frameworks of Angular, React.js, Bootstrap 5. (I know it's all front-end but got to start somewhere.)
- As I gain more information and related skills I'll update with the appropriate steps towards my goal in my learning process.
